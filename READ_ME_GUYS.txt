In order to run this on your machines, you will need to install node and sails, download and install node with the installer package, then run the following line


// this lets you use sails as a command from the command line
sudo npm -g install sails




This will make it possible to run sails from terminal.
Then, in order to launch the site with its own server, you navigate to the root of the site, in this case it is the project2 directory in the repo, you will have to do the next two commands



// this will install any dependencies the app needs
npm install



// this launches the app at localhost:1337
sails lift
